// Exercise 6.8
/* A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours.
 * The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof
 * in excess of three hours.
 * The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00.
 * Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time.
 * Write an application that calculates and displays the parking charges for each
 * customer who parked in the garage yesterday.
 * You should enter the hours parked for each customer.
 * The program should display the charge for the current customer and should calculate
 * and display the running total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts.
 * It should use the method calculateCharges to determine the charge for each customer.
