/* (Hypotenuse Calculations) Define a method hypotenuse that calculates the hypotenuse
 * of a right triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are given.
 * The method should take two arguments of type double and return the hypotenuse as a double.
 * Incorporate this method into an application that reads values for side1 and side2 and
 *  performs the calculation with the hypotenuse method. Use Math methods pow and sqrt to
 *  determine the length of the hypotenuse for each of the triangles in Fig.6.14 .
 *  [Note:Class Math also provides method hypot to perform this calculation.]
