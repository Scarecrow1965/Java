//Exercise 2.35
// Research several car-pooling websites. Create an application that calculates
// your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much money could be saved
// by car pooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions
// and reducing traffic congestion. The application should input the following
// information and display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work:
// 1.	Total miles driven per day. (I will change this to km as we are Canadian)
// 2.	Cost per gallon of gasoline. (I will change this to litres as we are Canadian)
// 3.	Average miles per gallon. (I will change this to km/litres as we Canadian)
// 4.	Parking fees per day.
// 5.	Tolls per day.
