//Exercise 4.34
/* Write an application that keeps displaying in the command window the multiples
 * of the integer 2â€”namely, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on.
 * Your loop should not terminate (i.e., it should create an infinite loop).
 * What happens when you run this program? */

// answer to question is that program ends when it reaches max integer size.
