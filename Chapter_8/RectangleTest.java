/*(Rectangle Class)
 * Create a class Rectangle with attributes length and width, each of which defaults to 1.
 * Provide methods that calculate the rectangleâ€™s perimeter and area.
 * It has set and get methods for both length and width.
 * The set methods should verify that length and width are each floating-point numbers larger
 * than 0.0 and less than 20.0.
 * Write a program to test class Rectangle. */
